This is a place for my learning of the following:
1. Compiler design
2. Principles of programming languages

I'm learning ppl practically by learning the following languages
1. Haskell - to learn about functional paradigms
2. Assembly - need I explain why?
3. Coq - For personal goals - the language I want to design in the future is going to pull aspects of formal logic
4. (maybe) Verilog - I wathced a Lex friedman podcast and one of his guests suggested these languages, and brought up a good point that verilog is very different than assembly, in that it operates directly with hardware
5. C - Practicing the fundamentals

My end goal is to write a compiler and design a language

Resources:
1. Haskell [cis1940](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/lectures.html)
2. Coq [Core docs](coq.inria.fr/refman)
3. Assembly - I'll be practicing in x86_64 assembly
